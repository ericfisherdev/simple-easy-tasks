# Foreign Key Constraints Test Results

## Overview

This test suite documents the actual behavior of PocketBase regarding foreign key constraint enforcement in the Simple Easy Tasks project.

## Key Findings

### 1. Foreign Key Constraint Enforcement

**PocketBase does NOT enforce foreign key constraints at the SQLite level by default.** This means:

- Tasks can be created with non-existent project IDs
- Tasks can be created with non-existent reporter/assignee IDs  
- Comments can be created with non-existent task IDs
- Projects can be created with non-existent owner IDs
- Records can be updated to reference non-existent related records

### 2. Referential Integrity Issues

The lack of FK constraint enforcement leads to several referential integrity issues:

- **Orphaned Records**: Records exist with broken foreign key references
- **Inconsistent Queries**: Repository queries may return unexpected results for broken references
- **Data Quality**: Database contains invalid references that would normally be rejected

### 3. Cascade Behavior

The test results show mixed cascade behavior:

- **Comments**: Despite schema configuration `"cascadeDelete": true`, comments were NOT automatically deleted when their parent task was deleted
- **Projects/Tasks**: Users and projects can be deleted leaving orphaned dependent records
- **Implementation Gap**: The cascade delete behavior in the schema is not enforced in practice

### 4. Practical Implications

#### For Development
- Application-level validation becomes critical
- Repository implementations must handle broken references gracefully
- Service layers should implement integrity checks
- Consider implementing custom constraints in business logic

#### For Data Quality
- Regular data integrity checks should be implemented
- Cleanup processes may be needed for orphaned records
- Monitoring for broken references should be in place

#### for Testing
- Tests should verify actual behavior, not expected behavior
- Integration tests must account for lack of constraint enforcement
- Referential integrity must be tested at the application level

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement Application-Level Validation**: Add validation in repositories and services to check foreign key validity before creating/updating records
2. **Add Data Integrity Checks**: Implement regular background jobs to identify and handle orphaned records
3. **Review Repository Logic**: Ensure all repository methods handle broken references appropriately

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Enable SQLite Foreign Keys**: Consider enabling `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` in PocketBase if possible
2. **Custom Constraint Layer**: Implement a custom constraint validation layer above PocketBase
3. **Alternative Backend**: Consider migrating to a backend that enforces referential integrity if data consistency is critical

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Creation with invalid foreign keys
- ✅ Updates to invalid foreign keys  
- ✅ Valid relationship creation and validation
- ✅ Cascade delete behavior testing
- ✅ Complex hierarchy validation
- ✅ Impact of broken references on queries
- ✅ Dependency handling during deletions

## Usage

Run the tests with:
```bash
go test -tags=integration ./internal/testutil/integration -run TestForeignKeyConstraints -v
```

The tests will document the actual behavior with log messages indicating whether PocketBase enforced constraints or allowed referential integrity violations.

## Conclusion

While PocketBase provides many benefits as a backend solution, **referential integrity must be handled at the application level** for this project. The foreign key constraint tests serve as both documentation of current behavior and a foundation for implementing proper data integrity measures.
